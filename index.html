     why should you go to space?   
    </h2> 
    
  <ul id="list"> 
     <li>  help collect new info about planets and such</li>
    <li> pretty sights </li>

    <h3> how would you get there? 
    </h3>
    <br> 
    <strong id="spacecraft">A spacecraft is a vehicle that flies in space. It can carry astronauts, cargo, or instruments to their destination, or it can be the destination. The International Space Station is a spacecraft, just like the smaller vehicles that deliver crew and cargo to it. </strong> 
    <br> 
    <h3>
      what was the first spaceship?
    </h3> 
    <br> 
    <em class="sputnik">The first spacecraft, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, was launched on October 4, 1957; it weighed 83.6 kg (184 pounds). It was soon followed by other unmanned Soviet and U.S. spacecraft and, within four years (April 12, 1961), by the first manned spacecraft, Vostok 1, which carried the Soviet cosmonaut Yury Gagarin </em> 
    <h3>
      how long would it take to travel to mars... 
    </h3>
    <h4 class="mars"> If you dream of one day being an astronaut on the first manned flight to Mars, be prepared for a long trip. Scientists estimate a trip to Mars and back would take 400-450 days.</h4>
